# SampleShoppingApp
This app has been built as a practice app learnt from a course. 
Sample Shopping App Layout, the app show the content in Table View, Collection View.

Configurations: 
Swift 5, Xcode version: 11.5 , MacOS version: 10.15.7

How it works:
The app shows usage of Table View and Collection View.
On launching the app, a table view appears that shows different categories for shopping. 
After clicking on one od the cells it take to next page where some items are added in collection view for that selected category.

I am still a learner, any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.
